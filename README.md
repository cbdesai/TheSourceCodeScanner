# Source Code Scanner
A Source Code repository to scan entire TFS,VSS for specific set of information like database call, driver, Store proc call...
Developed for .Net but can be used for other language source code. 
Developed in PowerShell, if time permits I will create Python script to run on Unix variant
I used it for C#, VB code but you can use it for Store procedure, database function or any other language.
